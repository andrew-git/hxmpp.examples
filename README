BUILD+RUN
---------
In order to compile and run the tests the HXMPP library has to be in the same directory.

Most of the tests extend the ClientBase class in the root directory.
If compiled to javascript a jabber.BOSHConnection will get used to connect to the server.
All other targets use a jabber.SocketConnection.

Two (local) client accounts are used:
* romeo
* julia

You will have to create these to run the tests.
