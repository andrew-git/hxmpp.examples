BUILD+RUN
---------
Most of the tests extend the ClientBase class in the root directory.
If compiled to javascript a BOSHConnection will get used to connect to the server.
All other targets use a SocketConnection.

Two (local) client accounts are used:
* romeo
* julia
.. create these to run the tests.
