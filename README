HXMPP.examples
==============
Examples and tests for the HXMPP library (http://hxmpp.disktree.net).


BUILD
-----
To build all examples/tests run: haxe build.hxml


RUN EXAMPLES
------------
Most of the tests extend the ClientBase class in the root directory.
If so, the javascript/browser target uses a BOSHConnection to connect to the server,
all other targets use a SocketConnection as default setting.

You probably have to modify the ip address and host settings in the source files.
Default ip: localhost
Default host name: disktree
Default http path: localhost/httpbind


Two (local) client accounts are used:
* romeo@disktree (default)
* romeo@disktree
Create these (or modify the jid's in source code) to run the tests.
