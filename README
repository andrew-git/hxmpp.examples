HXMPP.examples
==============
Example usages and tests for the HXMPP library (http://hxmpp.disktree.net).


BUILD
-----
haxe build.hxml
... to build all examples/tests.


RUN EXAMPLES
------------

Most of the tests extend the ClientBase class in the root directory.
If so, the javascript/browser target uses a BOSHConnection to connect to the server,
all other targets use a SocketConnection as default setting.

Two (local) client accounts are used:
* romeo
* julia
.. create these to run the tests.
