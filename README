BUILD+RUN
---------
$haxe build.hxml to build all examples/tests.
Most of the tests extend the ClientBase class in the root directory.
If so, js/browser target uses a BOSHConnection to connect to the server, all other targets use a SocketConnection for default.

Two (local) client accounts are used:
* romeo
* julia
.. create these to run the tests.
